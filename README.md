# Python wrapper for Stanford OpenIE

Open information extraction (open IE) refers to the extraction of structured relation triples from plain text, such that the schema for these relations does not need to be specified in advance. For example, Barack Obama was born in Hawaii would create a triple `(Barack Obama; was born in; Hawaii)`, corresponding to the open domain relation "was born in". CoreNLP is a Java implementation of an open IE system as described in the paper:

## Installation
`pip install stanford_openie`

## Example
```python
from openie import StanfordOpenIE

with StanfordOpenIE() as client:
    text = 'Barack Obama was born in Hawaii. Richard Manning wrote this sentence.'
    print('Text: %s.' % text)
    for triple in client.annotate(text):
        print('|-', triple)

    graph_image = 'graph.png'
    client.generate_graphviz_graph(text, graph_image)
    print('Graph generated: %s.' % graph_image)

    with open('corpus/pg6130.txt', 'r', encoding='utf8') as r:
        corpus = r.read().replace('\n', ' ').replace('\r', '')

    triples_corpus = client.annotate(corpus[0:50000])
    print('Corpus: %s [...].' % corpus[0:80])
    print('Found %s triples in the corpus.' % len(triples_corpus))
    for triple in triples_corpus[:3]:
        print('|-', triple)
 ```
 
 *Expected output*
 ```
 |- {'subject': 'Barack Obama', 'relation': 'was', 'object': 'born'}
 |- {'subject': 'Barack Obama', 'relation': 'was born in', 'object': 'Hawaii'}
 |- {'subject': 'Richard Manning', 'relation': 'wrote', 'object': 'sentence'}
 Graph generated: graph.png.
 Corpus: ﻿According to this document, the city of Cumae in Ćolia, was, at an early period [...].
 Found 1664 triples in the corpus.
 |- {'subject': 'city', 'relation': 'is in', 'object': 'Ćolia'}
 |- {'subject': 'Menapolus', 'relation': 'son of', 'object': 'Ithagenes'}
 |- {'subject': 'Menapolus', 'relation': 'was Among', 'object': 'immigrants'}
 ```
 
It will generate a [GraphViz DOT](http://www.graphviz.org/) in `graph.png`:

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/out.png"><br><br>
</div>

Note: Make sure GraphViz is installed beforehand. Try to run the `dot` command to see if this is the case. If not, run `sudo apt-get install graphviz` if you're running on Ubuntu.
